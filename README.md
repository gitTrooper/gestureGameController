🖐️ Hand Gesture Control for Games using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI

This project allows you to control the movement of a character in games using hand gestures detected through your laptop's webcam. The direction of your hand's movement guides the movement of the character. This project can be adapted to work with any game or application that can be controlled using keyboard inputs.


✨ Features

->Real-time hand detection using webcam

->Gesture recognition to control game character movement

->Adaptable to various games and applications


🛠️ Technologies Used

->Python: Programming language used for scripting.

->OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision.

->MediaPipe: Framework for building machine learning pipelines to perform hand tracking.

->PyAutoGUI: Library for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.


🚀 Usage

->Run the script:

python hand_gesture_control.py

->Control your game:

Move your hand left, right, up, or down to control the character in the game.
